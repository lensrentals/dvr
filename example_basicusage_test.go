// Recording: In this mode all HTTP calls are recorded into a file (the default
//            is testdata/archive.dvr, and is control by -dvr.file)
//   go test -dvr.record .
//
// Replay: In this mode all HTTP calls are replayed from the recording file
//         captured in Recording mode above.
//   go test -dvr.replay .

// * Note that this function needs the leading underscore removed in order
